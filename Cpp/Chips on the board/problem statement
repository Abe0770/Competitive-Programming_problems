You are given a board of size n×n (n rows and n colums) and two arrays of positive integers a and b of size n.

Your task is to place the chips on this board so that the following condition is satisfied for every cell (i,j):

  There exists at least one chip in the same column or in the same row as the cell (i,j).I. e. there exists a cell (x,y) such that there is a chip in that cell, and either x=i or y=j (or both).

The cost of putting a chip in the cell (i,j) is equal to ai+bj.

For example, for n=3, a=[1,4,1] and b=[3,2,2]. One of the possible chip placements is as follows:




The total cost of that placement is (1+3)+(1+2)+(1+2)=10.

Calculate the minimum possible total cost of putting chips according to the rules above.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤3⋅105).

The second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109).

The third line contains n integers b1,b2,…,bn (1≤bi≤109).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3⋅105.

Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum possible total cost of putting chips according to the rules.
