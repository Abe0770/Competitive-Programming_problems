## Introduction üòÄ

Competitive programming is a great way to improve **problem-solving skills** and **algorithmic thinking**. This repository serves as both a personal log of my problem-solving journey and a resource for others who are interested in learning from my solutions.

Feel free to explore the different problem categories and check out the solutions provided. I hope you find them helpful and educational.

## Problem Categories

The problems in this repository are categorized based on the programming language.

For Instance:

- Problems that are solved using Cpp programming language are inside the **Cpp** folder.

## Solutions üí°

In this section, you can find solutions to the problems organized by the problem's name. Each problem's folder contains the following files:

- `problem.md`: A description of the problem statement.
- `solution.cpp` (or other language extensions): My solution to the problem in a well-commented code.

You should create a folder by the name of the programming language you are using.

**Note**: Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you spot any mistakes or have better solutions to the problems. Constructive feedback is always welcome! üòÄ

## Contributing ü§ù

Contributions are always welcome! If you have solved new problems or improved existing solutions, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.

```
Note: Whichever language you are using to solve the problem, name the branch in that manner.

For example: If you are using python, then your branch name should be problem/python
```

3. Make your modifications and add your solutions.
4. Ensure your code and explanations are well-documented.
5. Create a pull request, and I'll review it as soon as possible.
